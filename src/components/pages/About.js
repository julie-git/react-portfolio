              <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Julie and I am creative and passionate about turning great ideas into tangible software.</p>

              <p>After earning a degree in Computer Science, I worked at corporations and startups developing and leading Technical projects. At Verizon and Humana I lead major initiatives in transforming both technical platforms and processes to improve Software Quality. I worked closely with the Sofware Architects, vendors, QA and Business. </p>

              <p>   I am a recent graduate of the University of Washington full-time Web Development Programming Bootcamp. I have the foundational knowledge of a full-stack developer (MERN), prior experience in leading technical projects, and experience as in QA, which gives me a unique perspective on managing technical projects.  I enjoy working with teams on throughout the full project lifecyle and the pride that comes from delivering a quality product.  I look forward to bringing my professional and educational experiences to my next employer.</p>
